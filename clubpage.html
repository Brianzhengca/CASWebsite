          rainfall averages, nor even how exactly the indigenous peoples might react to their 
          presence. It would be fair to say that sending the First Fleet out to New South Wales 
          was a calculated risk; that the colony survived and progressed is due almost entirely to 
          the arrival of the Second Fleet in June 1790. The arrival of these ships saved the colony 
          from starvation and certain death. From then onwards, as ships came out on a regular 
          basis with convict labour and supplies on board, the colony flourished and the gradual 
          exploration and settlement of the continent began.v
          The reasons that led the British to invade Australia were simple. The prisons in Britain 
          had become unbearably overcrowded, a situation worsened by the refusal of America to 
          take any more convicts after the American War of Independence in 1783. Crime rates 
          were rising across the nation while large numbers of people were moving away from 
          rural areas to the increasingly industrialised cities where unemployment ran high as 
          machines replaced man power. An estimated one million people in Britain were below 
          the bread line in 1788. 
          Britain had looked at other geographical areas with regard to establishing penal colonies 
          such as the west coast of Africa. This option was deemed unviable as the waters were 
          extremely dangerous along the coast; Britain had no proper foothold in the area and it 
          was concluded that the risk of escape was high. Early contact had revealed that the 
          indigenous populations on the coast of West Africa could indeed be bellicose. This was 
          not a good scenario for a penal colony! On the other hand, the Indigenous Peoples of 
          Australia had barely been seen, and descriptions of those that had were deemed to be of 
          a more friendly nature. There has long been a debate, known to some as ‚ÄúThe Botany 
          Bay Debate‚Äù, that Australia was also chosen by the British with regard to the possibility 
          of acquiring flax and timber, because of the need to protect the trade routes to China, 
          and in order to consolidate Cook‚Äôs possession of the continent for Britain. Whatever the 
          debate, there is no doubt that the need to relocate the burgeoning convict population was 
          the reason which prevailed over others. 
          The British had long been experts in transporting human cargo. Transportation of felons 
          to America had begun in the seventeenth century and although the total number of those 
          transported is not known, it is estimated to be in the region of fifty thousand. Similarly 
          Britain had played a large lucrative role in the slave trade, abolished in 1807, though 
          slavery itself remained legal until the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. It seems ironic that 
          while abolishing the slave trade and slavery, the British continued to transport convicts 
          to Australia for some time after 1833. Convicts were of course judicially not slaves and 
          transportation continued until the 1850s. The reason why transportation finally came to 
          an end was due in part to activism in England against it and the government‚Äôs and 
          colonial authorities‚Äô belief that the continued arrival of convicts would have a longlasting detrimental effect on the new colonial society. A further side to transportation of 
          convicts by the British is that of inter-colonial transportation such as that to the 
          Andaman Islands, which began as a result of the Indian rebellion in 1857. A study of 
          inter-colonial transportation within the British Empire reveals that the practice of 
          transporting felons, dissidents and so forth to other places in the empire was widely 
          practiced.
          The invasion of Australia by the British, both convict and free, has tragic dimensions to 
          it pertinent to the title of this book. On the one hand there were the convicts who were

          forcibly removed, uprooted and exiled from their homeland and, on the other, their 
          presence in Australia, together with that of the free migrants, brought about the 
          displacement of the Indigenous peoples of Australia. Worse than that, in time the 
          Indigenous peoples were to find themselves exiled from their homeland and embroiled 
          in a cultural dislocation, brought about by British and colonial intervention against th</p>

          peoples, the evidence of which remains only too strongly with us today. Genocide went 
          hand in hand with the policy of eugenics which in turn led to the forced removal of halfcaste children from their families, bringing about an exile upon exile. Indigenous 
          peoples were exiled from their lands and taken into missions and then their children, 
          often the product of rape, though also of long/short standing relationships with the white 
          man, were dragged away from their mothers and taken thousands of miles away to be 
          ‚Äúeducated‚Äù, thereby becoming doubly exiled from their familial roots. The stories that 
          emerge from what has become known as ‚ÄúThe Stolen Generation‚Äù are harrowing.
          When I was about twelve or thirteen years old I was taken to Moola Bulla. That's 
          where I lost my Aboriginal ways. The Police came one day from Halls Creek 
          when they were going on patrol to Lansdowne and found me, a half-caste child. 
          The manager ... took me down to Fitzroy Crossing to wait for the mail truck from 
          Derby to take me to Moola Bulla. When [the manager's wife] told my people, 
          mum and dad, that they were taking me to Fitzroy Crossing for a trip, they told 
          her `you make sure you bring her back'. They did not know that I would never see 
          them again (HREOC Report 1997 quoted by Kimberley Land Council submission 
          345 on page 66, chapter 7).
          The systematic attempt to wipe out the Indigenous peoples of Australia by whatever 
          means was doomed to failure given the tenacity, courage and underestimated strength of 
          the people themselves. It has often been said that Australia was built on the backs of 
          convict slave labour. Now, we are more enlightened as to who was treated like a slave 
          on their own land:
          When anybody come to pick up a worker they used to line us up and they'd make 
          you flex your muscles. If you were big and strong they'd pick you - like a slave 
          market. I was sent out at 11. I worked there for seven and a half years, never got 
          paid anything, all that time. We used to bring the cattle in ... we didn't get nothing. 
          So I had to join the army to survive (HREOC Report April 1997. Confidential 
          evidence 549, Northern Territory: man removed in the 1930s, chapter 7).
          In 1997 the HREOC report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal 
          and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, Bringing them Home
          underlined the far reaching damage done by the policy of taking Aboriginal half-caste 
          children away from their families.
          Grief and loss are the predominant themes of this report. Tenacity and survival are 
          also acknowledged. It is no ordinary report. Much of its subject matter is so 
          personal and intimate that ordinarily it would not be discussed. These matters 
          have only been discussed with the Inquiry with great difficulty and much personal 
          distress. The suffering and the courage of those who have told their stories inspire 
          sensitivity and respect.</p>
